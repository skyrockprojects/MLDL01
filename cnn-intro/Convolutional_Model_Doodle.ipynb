    "\n",
    "The previous tutorial showed that a simple linear model had about 91% classification accuracy for recognizing hand-written digits in the MNIST data-set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will implement a simple Convolutional Neural Network in TensorFlow which has a classification accuracy of about 99%, or more if you make some of the suggested exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Networks work by moving small filters across the input image. This means the filters are re-used for recognizing patterns throughout the entire input image. This makes the Convolutional Networks much more powerful than Fully-Connected networks with the same number of variables. This in turn makes the Convolutional Networks faster to train."

    "The input image is processed in the first convolutional layer using the filter-weights. This results in 16 new images, one for each filter in the convolutional layer. The images are also down-sampled so the image resolution is decreased from 28x28 to 14x14.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 16 smaller images are then processed in the second convolutional layer. We need filter-weights for each of these 16 channels, and we need filter-weights for each output channel of this layer. There are 36 output channels so there are a total of 16 x 36 = 576 filters in the second convolutional layer. The resulting images are down-sampled again to 7x7 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the second convolutional layer is 36 images of 7x7 pixels each. These are then flattened to a single vector of length 7 x 7 x 36 = 1764, which is used as the input to a fully-connected layer with 128 neurons (or elements). This feeds into another fully-connected layer with 10 neurons, one for each of the classes, which is used to determine the class of the image, that is, which number is depicted in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional filters are initially chosen at random, so the classification is done randomly. The error between the predicted and true class of the input image is measured as the so-called cross-entropy. The optimizer then automatically propagates this error back through the Convolutional Network using the chain-rule of differentiation and updates the filter-weights so as to improve the classification error. This is done iteratively thousands of times until the classification error is sufficiently low.\n",
    "\n",
    "These particular filter-weights and intermediate images are the results of one optimization run and may look different if you re-run this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the computation in TensorFlow is actually done on a batch of images instead of a single image, which makes the computation more efficient. This means the flowchart actually has one more data-dimension when implemented in TensorFlow."

    "The following chart shows the basic idea of processing an image in the first convolutional layer. The input image depicts the number 7 and four copies of the image are shown here, so we can see more clearly how the filter is being moved to different positions of the image. For each position of the filter, the dot-product is being calculated between the filter and the image pixels under the filter, which results in a single pixel in the output image. So moving the filter across the entire input image results in a new image being generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The red filter-weights means that the filter has a positive reaction to black pixels in the input image, while blue pixels means the filter has a negative reaction to black pixels.\n",

    "The step-size for moving the filter across the input is called the stride. There is a stride for moving the filter horizontally (x-axis) and another stride for moving vertically (y-axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the source-code below, the stride is set to 1 in both directions, which means the filter starts in the upper left corner of the input image and is being moved 1 pixel to the right in each step. When the filter reaches the end of the image to the right, then the filter is moved back to the left side and 1 pixel down the image. This continues until the filter has reached the lower right corner of the input image and the entire output image has been generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the filter reaches the end of the right-side as well as the bottom of the input image, then it can be padded with zeroes (white pixels). This causes the output image to be of the exact same dimension as the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the output of the convolution may be passed through a so-called Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), which merely ensures that the output is positive because negative values are set to zero. The output may also be down-sampled by so-called max-pooling, which considers small windows of 2x2 pixels and only keeps the largest of those pixels. This halves the resolution of the input image e.g. from 28x28 to 14x14 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the second convolutional layer is more complicated because it takes 16 input channels. We want a separate filter for each input channel, so we need 16 filters instead of just one. Furthermore, we want 36 output channels from the second convolutional layer, so in total we need 16 x 36 = 576 filters for the second convolutional layer. It can be a bit challenging to understand how this works."

    "## TensorFlow Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire purpose of TensorFlow is to have a so-called computational graph that can be executed much more efficiently than if the same calculations were to be performed directly in Python. TensorFlow can be more efficient than NumPy because TensorFlow knows the entire computation graph that must be executed, while NumPy only knows the computation of a single mathematical operation at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can also automatically calculate the gradients that are needed to optimize the variables of the graph so as to make the model perform better. This is because the graph is a combination of simple mathematical expressions so the gradient of the entire graph can be calculated using the chain-rule for derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can also take advantage of multi-core CPUs as well as GPUs - and Google has even built special chips just for TensorFlow which are called TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) and are even faster than GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A TensorFlow graph consists of the following parts which will be detailed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Placeholder variables used for inputting data to the graph.\n",
    "* Variables that are going to be optimized so as to make the convolutional network perform better.\n",
    "* The mathematical formulas for the convolutional network.\n",
    "* A cost measure that can be used to guide the optimization of the variables.\n",
    "* An optimization method which updates the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the TensorFlow graph may also contain various debugging statements e.g. for logging data to be displayed using TensorBoard, which is not covered in this tutorial."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that a Convolutional Neural Network works much better at recognizing hand-written digits than the simple linear model in Tutorial #01. The Convolutional Network gets a classification accuracy of about 99%, or even more if you make some adjustments, compared to only 91% for the simple linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Convolutional Network is also much more complicated to implement, and it is not obvious from looking at the filter-weights why it works and why it sometimes fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we would like an easier way to program Convolutional Neural Networks and we would also like a better way of visualizing their inner workings."

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "These are a few suggestions for exercises that may help improve your skills with TensorFlow. It is important to get hands-on experience with TensorFlow in order to learn how to use it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to backup this Notebook before making any changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do you get the exact same results if you run the Notebook multiple times without changing any parameters? What are the sources of randomness?\n",
    "* Run another 10,000 optimization iterations. Are the results better?\n",
    "* Change the learning-rate for the optimizer.\n",
    "* Change the configuration of the layers, such as the number of convolutional filters, the size of those filters, the number of neurons in the fully-connected layer, etc.\n",
    "* Add a so-called drop-out layer after the fully-connected layer. Note that the drop-out probability should be zero when calculating the classification accuracy, so you will need a placeholder variable for this probability.\n",
    "* Change the order of ReLU and max-pooling in the convolutional layer. Does it calculate the same thing? What is the fastest way of computing it? How many calculations are saved? Does it also work for Sigmoid-functions and average-pooling?\n",
    "* Add one or more convolutional and fully-connected layers. Does it help performance?\n",
    "* What is the smallest possible configuration that still gives good results?\n",
    "* Try using ReLU in the last fully-connected layer. Does the performance change? Why?\n",
    "* Try not using pooling in the convolutional layers. Does it change the classification accuracy and training time?\n",
    "* Try using a 2x2 stride in the convolution instead of max-pooling? What is the difference?\n",
    "* Remake the program yourself without looking too much at this source-code.\n",
    "* Explain to a friend how the program works."
